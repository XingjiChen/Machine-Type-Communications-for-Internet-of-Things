/**
 * \brief class Dragon is an abstract class that describes a dragon.
 *
 * Each Dragon object has a name (string), age (size_t), size (size_t) and a
 * list of Treasure objects that the Dragon has hoarded.
 *
 * The class has the following protected members, which means they are
 * accessible to classes which inherit this class: name (std::string), age
 * (size_t), size (size_t), treasures (std::list<Treasure>).
 *
 * Functions:
 *
 * The constructor takes the Dragon's name (const std::string&), age (size_t)
 * and size (size_t) as a parameter and initializes them to the parameter values.
